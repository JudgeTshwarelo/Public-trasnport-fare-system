# Public-trasnport-fare-system
This is a Python project that simulates a city bus fare calculation system based on passenger age category and travel distance. It calculates transport fares using predefined pricing rules for passengers, enforces a  minimum fare, tracks available bus seats, and maintains passenger and revenue statistics until the bus is full.
